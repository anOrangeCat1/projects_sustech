# A Robotic Arm-Based Portrait Drawing System

This project primarily utilized Python programming. It also used the ROS package provided by the robotic arm manufacturer for basic control.

My two teammates were responsible for **image processing part**, which involved extracting the contours and points from the input portrait images, sorting and grouping the points to represent different brush strokes. 

I was primarily responsible for **robotic arm control part**, ensuring that the robotic arm moved according to the sorted coordinate points to complete the artwork.

For control part, primarily, we used **PID control**. However, due to limitations in hardware precision, the joints of the robotic arm mainly employed **PD control**. Some of the parameters are shown in the figure belowï¼š
