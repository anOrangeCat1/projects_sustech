# Age-Changing Camera

This project is based on GANs(Generative Adversarial Networks). To make the task simple, I use **PaddleGAN** frame work. When you input a photo, this project will output a photo that looks both younger and older.

Though this project, I can learn some about GANs. The folder _GAN_try_ is try to realize a simple GAN. Two papers were read, which were _HyperStyle_StyleGAN_Inversion_with_HyperNetworks_for_Real_Image_Editing_ and
_Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks_.

The folder _Aging_Camera_Based_on_Paddle_ contains my Python script, but if you want to run them, you must download PaddleGan framework first. Link: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleGAN . 
Once you have successfully deployed Paddle locally, put all things of _"Aging_Camera_Based_on_Paddle"_ in same directory, then you can run it successfully.

The results are shown as following, which are fun:
