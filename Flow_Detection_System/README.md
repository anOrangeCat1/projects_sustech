# Multi-Scenario Flow Intelligent Detection System Based on RPI and OpenCV

With the advancement of artificial intelligence technology and deep learning object detection algorithms, in response to the demand for building smart cities today, 
this project focused on multi-category traffic flow measurement. It improved the system architecture, reduced data processing load, and accelerated data computation and transmission.
This intelligent detection system used a Raspberry Pi 4B with a camera, using the YOLOv5 framework, building an OpenCV image object detection architecture for various scenarios 
such as nucleic acid testing, and uploaded relevant data to a cloud server. Further processing of recognition data is carried out on the PC, and the visualized results are displayed on a web page 
for real-time access by users.

I was responsable for the part of intelligent detection using YOLOv5 and my teammates built remote control and TCP construction.

The final results were attached as below:
