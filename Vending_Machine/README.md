# Implementing an Automatic Vending Machine Using Logic Circuits

In this project, I was responsible for logic circuit design and simulating it in Multisim.

Firstly, I designed every part of whole circuit to complete specific functions, such as inserting 1 yuan, inserting 5 yuan or accelaration of all money and so on. 

Only some basic chips were used, such as adders and decoders.

Each part circuit was named by its function, and whole logic circuit, which could work as a vending machine, was named **"Vending_Machine_System.ms14"**.

Also, the pre ppt and report were attached.

Final logic circuit was like below:
