# Drawing Board Based on Hand Recognization Based by OpenCV

In this project, I was primarily responsible for building the overall framework and implementing gesture recognition.

Because I have almost no knowledge of AI and computer vision, I just searched for relevant information and found some projects that I can use.

When using specific hand gesture, the program would record the track of moving hand. After that, it could tell what the shape was.

In the end, I designed the whole system just operated by hand recogniztion, which meant you can just change hand gesture to control it.

The effect was like:
