This repository is to record my all undergraduate projects in sustech.

You can click on specific folders to view detailed information about the projects. Some are code of prjects and some of them are code exercises during the learning process. 

I have also uploaded some reports and PowerPoint presentations in PDF format. Some of them are in English, and others are in Chinese.

If you are interested in these projects and find them helpful, please feel free to download and use them.
