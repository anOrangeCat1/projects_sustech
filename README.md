**_Discription of project:_** This is a project for a robot control course. It involves using a robotic arm to draw portrait sketches. The process begins with inputting a real portrait photograph. Image processing techniques are then applied to extract the outline of the portrait, which is transformed into a series of ordered coordinate points. These points serve as the path for the robotic arm to follow. Finally, the robotic arm is controlled to move along the generated path, ultimately completing the portrait drawing.

**_Individual contribution:_** I formed a path for the robotic arm by using the sorted pixel coordinates and became proficient in utilizing the **ROS** package provided by the robotic arm manufacturer for basic control. I applied the **PID control algorithm** to control the robotic arm for the purpose of creating artwork. 

The final result is depicted in the following image:

_bilibili:_ https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gu4y1p77T

**_Discription of project:_** This is a project for a sensor course. The requirement was to design an innovative weight sensor without using any strain gauges. It needed to measure random weights in the range of 0-1.5 kg with high accuracy and relatively fast response time. We adopted the principle of torque balance and used the PD control algorithm to control a DC motor to raise the object being weighed to its balanced position. By measuring the motor torque at equilibrium and conducting calibration, we completed the design of the Innovative sensor.

In the end, this new sensor exhibits excellent performance: **measurement error within 2%**, **response time within 5s**, and calibration data indicating a **near-linear relationship between input and output**.

**_Individual contribution:_** Mastered the basic principles of DC motors and implemented position control using the **PID control algorithm**. It was approximated that the motor torque was linearly related to the current magnitude, and **calibration** allowed us to measure the weight of objects using this method.

The final project looked like the following image:

**_Discription of project:_** 
This project focuses on solving multi-class object detection challenges, improving system architecture, reducing data processing loads, and speeding up data computation and transmission. The intelligent detection system utilizes a **Raspberry Pi 4B** equipped with a camera, employs the **YOLOv5** framework for model training, and builds an **OpenCV**-based image **object detection** framework for various scenarios, including nucleic acid testing. The identified data is uploaded to a cloud server, further processed via a PC interface, and presented with visualization on a web page for real-time access by users.

**_Individual contribution:_**
I have completed the deployment of **YOLOv5** on a Raspberry Pi, using a simplified lightweight version, achieving approximately 4 frames per second (fps) and enabling real-time detection. It can detect various objects in multiple scenarios. Finally, the system provides a count of objects within the frame.
