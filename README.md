## A Robotic Arm-Based Portrait Drawing System
**_2023.4~2023.6_**

_Team Project of 3 members_

**_Discription of project:_** This is a project for a robot control course. It involves using a robotic arm to draw portrait sketches. The process begins with inputting a real portrait photograph. Image processing techniques are then applied to extract the outline of the portrait, which is transformed into a series of ordered coordinate points. These points serve as the path for the robotic arm to follow. Finally, the robotic arm is controlled to move along the generated path, ultimately completing the portrait drawing.

**_Individual contribution:_** I formed a path for the robotic arm by using the sorted pixel coordinates and became proficient in utilizing the **ROS** package provided by the robotic arm manufacturer for basic control. I applied the **PID control algorithm** to control the robotic arm for the purpose of creating artwork. 

The final result is depicted in the following image:

## A Weight Measurement System Based on DC Motor
**_2023.3~2023.6_**

_Team Project of 2 members_

**_Discription of project:_** This is a project for a sensor course. The requirement was to design an innovative weight sensor without using any strain gauges. It needed to measure random weights in the range of 0-1.5 kg with high accuracy and relatively fast response time. We adopted the principle of torque balance and used the PD control algorithm to control a DC motor to raise the object being weighed to its balanced position. By measuring the motor torque at equilibrium and conducting calibration, we completed the design of the Innovative sensor.

**_Individual contribution:_** Mastered the basic principles of DC motors and implemented position control using the **PD control algorithm**. It was approximated that the motor torque was linearly related to the current magnitude, and **calibration** allowed us to measure the weight of objects using this method.

The final project looked like the following image:

## A Hair Transplant Robot Based on Hanâ€™s Collaborative Robot
**_2023.6~2023.7_**

_Team Project of 9 members_

**_Discription of project:_** This is a project with a focus on business. The Grand Robotics Company wanted to explore the use of robotic arms in the beauty and hairdressing industry. They required a product proposal based on their current collaborative robotic arm technology. After investigating the market size and assessing user needs, we proposed a product concept for a hair transplant robot. We designed the configuration of the robotic arm, conducted a feasibility analysis, and obtained approval from the Grand Robotics Company.

**_Individual contribution:_** Participated in market research, contributed to the design of the robotic arm configuration, prepared weekly reports and the final presentation, and collaborated with team members to advance the entire project.


The final configuration of the hair transplant robot is shown in the following image:

## A Smart Speaker Based on Raspberry Pi
**_2022.10~2023.1_**

_Team Project of 2 members_

**_Discription of project:_** 
This is a project for the Microcomputer Principles course. We used a Raspberry Pi as a development board and, based on it, connected various hardware components to develop a smart speaker. We mainly accomplished the following functions:
- Implemented a **wake-up function** using the Wukong open-source project.
- Integrated Baidu Intelligent Cloud API for voice recognition and synthesis, enabling **voice interactions**.
- Utilized web scraping to fetch weather information for **voice weather reports**.
- Integrated with the Turing Robot, enabling **basic conversations** (at that time, ChatGPT had not yet been released).
- Connected various hardware components and established a communication network for **smart home control**, such as voice-controlled light switches and remote control of air conditioning and so on.


**_Individual contribution:_** 
Completed the setup of the main program framework, implemented voice wake-up function, achieved voice interaction, enabled voice weather reporting, integrated with the Turing Robot and accomplished light control.
