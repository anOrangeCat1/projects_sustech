# Artificial Intelligent and Machine Learning Projects

There are several Folders here. 

**_MachineLearning_AndrewNg_** is some codes, lecture notes and tutorials of **AndrewNg's online course about ML**. Course Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms .

**_final_project_** is one of Kaggle competitions. _ecg_data.csv_ is data set, and the requirement is to use MLP, CNN, RNN and Transformer by Pytorch to establish prediction models. My final report
**"wyx_12012529_final_project.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results.

**_hand_ai_** is some codes from **Mu Li's online course about AI**. I learned how to build neural networks, such as MLP, RNN, LSTM and so on by Pytorch. Mu Li's channel: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478 ,
where you can find his all online courses. The course I learned is: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/channel/seriesdetail?sid=358497 . Thanks for his course.

**_lecture_study_code_** is some codes to realize contents mentioned in school courses.

**_midterm_project_** is also from Kaggle. There are two datasets in _data folder_, one of the two had fewer negative labled samples, and the requirement is to use Linear Regression and KNN by sklearn to establish 
prediction models.  My midterm report **"wyx_12012529.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results.
