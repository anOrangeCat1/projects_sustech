# Artificial Intelligent and Machine Learning Projects

There are several Folders here. 

**_MachineLearning_AndrewNg_** is some codes, lecture notes and tutorials of **AndrewNg's online course about ML**. Course Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms .

**_final_project_** is one of Kaggle competitions. _ecg_data.csv_ is data set, and the requirement is to use MLP, CNN, RNN and Transformer by Pytorch to establish prediction models. My final report
**"wyx_12012529_final_project.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results. One result of these cases is shown below:

**_hand_ai_** is some codes from **Mu Li's online course about AI**. I learned how to build neural networks, such as MLP, RNN, LSTM and so on by Pytorch. Mu Li's channel: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478 ,
where you can find his all online courses. The course I learned is: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/channel/seriesdetail?sid=358497 . Thanks for his course.

**_lecture_study_code_** is some codes to realize contents mentioned in school courses.

**_midterm_project_** is also from Kaggle. There are two datasets in _data folder_, one of the two had fewer negative labled samples, and the requirement is to use Linear Regression and KNN by sklearn to establish prediction models.  My midterm report **"wyx_12012529.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results.

In my opinion, this course had lots of drawbacks, but the most unbearable one was: NO LABs!!! Can you imagine that for a CS-related course, there was no lab class, which meant that within the class hours, they didn't teach you how to code! All programming required self-learning. Another serious problem was that too much content was taught in a short time, making it difficult to delve deeply into each topic.

All PPTs and contents were from Mu Li's online classes and MIT machine learning course. I think it was irresponsible. In the end, even though I spent a significant amount of time, my final grade was only a B. Out of the dozens of classmates who took this course as an elective, only two students received a score of 90 or above.

The advantages were also obvious: I could quickly grasp all the mainstream knowledge and popular algorithms related to AI and ML.

(Forgive me for venting so much, but the experience of this course has been incredibly painful.)
