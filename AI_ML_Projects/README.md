**_MachineLearning_AndrewNg_** is some codes, lecture notes and tutorials of **AndrewNg's online course about ML**. Course Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms .

**_final_project_** is one of Kaggle competitions. _ecg_data.csv_ is data set, and the requirement is to use MLP, CNN, RNN and Transformer by Pytorch to establish prediction models. My final report
**"wyx_12012529_final_project.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results. One result of these cases is shown below:

**_hand_ai_** is some codes from **Mu Li's online course about AI**. I learned how to build neural networks, such as MLP, RNN, LSTM and so on by Pytorch. Mu Li's channel: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478 ,
where you can find his all online courses. The course I learned is: https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/channel/seriesdetail?sid=358497 . Thanks for his course.

**_lecture_study_code_** is some codes to realize contents mentioned in school courses.

**_midterm_project_** is also from Kaggle. There are two datasets in _data folder_, one of the two had fewer negative labled samples, and the requirement is to use Linear Regression and KNN by sklearn to establish prediction models.  My midterm report **"wyx_12012529.pdf"** is also attached, containing details and training results.

Through this courses, I can learn the whole development of AI and ML and know about many important technology and algrithm nowadays, which is very helpful. However, the deeper learning is also necessary, because the content is too wide and students need to learn more on some specific aspects.
