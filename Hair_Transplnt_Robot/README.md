# Hair Transport Robot


**Han's Robotics** aims to enter the consumer market, building on its industrial robotic arm expertise, by developing beauty and hairdressing robots. Therefore, This is a project with a more **business-oriented focus**, so we only completed the configuration design of the robotic arm and a business feasibility analysis.

The initial goal was to establish a business plan for a medical robot. In the end, we decided to create a hair transplant robot. After investigating the market size and assessing user needs, we proposed a product concept for a hair transplant robot. We designed the configuration of the robotic arm, conducted a feasibility analysis, and obtained approval from the Han's Robotics Company. 

Currently, the prospects for using robotic arms in medical procedures are promising. For instance, in neurosurgery, robotic arms assist surgeons in delicate operations, increasing the success rate. In hair transplant surgeries, robotic arms can aid in tasks such as extracting hair follicles and implanting them. Among various medical scenarios, we have chosen to focus on the automation of robotic arms for hair transplant procedures.

Hair transplant surgery presents several pain points, including its time-consuming nature and the repetitive actions of the surgeon, making it suitable for robotic arm implementation. Hair transplantation involves eight main steps: preoperative examination, shaving the head, anesthesia, hair follicle extraction, follicle selection and separation, storage, puncturing, and implanting hair follicles.

The following illustrates the entire process of the design plan:

Furthermore, surgical operation planning in hair transplant procedures is another area of research. We aim to develop algorithms and software that can automatically plan and generate the paths for hair transplant operations. These algorithms will take into account various factors such as the shape of the patient's scalp, follicle density, and the target areas for implantation, to generate the optimal surgical path. Additionally, considering safety and efficiency during the operation, the robotic arm must be capable of avoiding sensitive areas or obstacles and completing the surgery in the shortest time possible, reducing the patient's discomfort.
