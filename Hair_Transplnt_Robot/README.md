# Hair Transport Robot


**Han's Robotics** aims to enter the consumer market, building on its industrial robotic arm expertise, by developing beauty and hairdressing robots. Therefore, This is a project with a more **business-oriented focus**, so we only completed the configuration design of the robotic arm and a business feasibility analysis.

The initial goal was to establish a business plan for a medical robot. In the end, we decided to create a hair transplant robot. After investigating the market size and assessing user needs, we proposed a product concept for a hair transplant robot. We designed the configuration of the robotic arm, conducted a feasibility analysis, and obtained approval from the Han's Robotics Company. The following illustrates the entire process of the design plan:
